Once a WooCommerce order has been marked as processed, a file upload screen will appear on the order details page.\r\n\r\n== Installation ==\r\n\t\r\n * Upload the plugin files to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory\r\n * Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress\r\n \r\n == Frequently Asked Questions ==\r\n\r\n= Why would I want the user to upload a file once payment has been made rather than during the checkout process? =\r\n\r\nIf you allowed every user to upload a file without yet making a payment then every time a payment failed or you used a payment method that waits for an IPN response, your disk space will be consumed by files you should not have received. By waiting until after payment this keeps things cleaner.\r\n\r\n= Where are files stored? =\r\n\r\nUploaded files are stored in your wp-content/uploads folder, a new folder named \"wc-pay-to-upload\" will be created and within that each order will have it's own folder based on the order ID.\r\n\r\n= How do I access the uploaded files? =\r\n\r\nOnce files are uploaded you can view them from the admin view of the order. A meta box is added to the side with links to the files.\r\n\r\n== Changelog ==\r\n\r\n=1.1.2=\r\n * Fixed the uploader issues which was not working in the newer wordpress versions.
