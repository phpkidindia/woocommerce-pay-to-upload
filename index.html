<p>Allow customers to pay to upload a file.</p>

<p>== Description ==</p>

<p>Allow customers to pay to upload a file. Once a WooCommerce order has been marked as processed, a file upload screen will appear on the order details page.</p>

<p>== Installation ==</p>

<ul>
<li>Upload the plugin files to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory</li>
<li>
<p>Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress</p>

<p>== Frequently Asked Questions ==</p>
</li>
</ul><p>= Why would I want the user to upload a file once payment has been made rather than during the checkout process? =</p>

<p>If you allowed every user to upload a file without yet making a payment then every time a payment failed or you used a payment method that waits for an IPN response, your disk space will be consumed by files you should not have received. By waiting until after payment this keeps things cleaner.</p>

<p>= Where are files stored? =</p>

<p>Uploaded files are stored in your wp-content/uploads folder, a new folder named "wc-pay-to-upload" will be created and within that each order will have it's own folder based on the order ID.</p>

<p>= How do I access the uploaded files? =</p>

<p>Once files are uploaded you can view them from the admin view of the order. A meta box is added to the side with links to the files.</p>
